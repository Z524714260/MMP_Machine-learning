# MMP_Machine-learning
This project focuses on predicting Minimum Miscibility Pressure (MMP) and addresses the challenges posed by the imbalanced nature of MMP datasets. Currently, we provide a curated MMP dataset along with the KMMSB model for MMP prediction, available for researchers to explore and study.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at Z524714260@163.com. I will respond as soon as possible when available.
The library configuration required to use the model is listed below:
pandas version: 1.5.0
numpy version: 1.21.0
matplotlib version: 3.5.2
shap version: 0.47.1
scikit-learn version: 1.0.2
The version of xgboost.sklearn in xgboost is 2.1.4
